In this analysis, four scenarios are explored: a business-as-usual scenario, a scenario where only Room for the River is applied, a scenario where only dike heightening is implemented, and the final policy that resulted from the debate. 

The_ 'Final_MORDM_and_ScenarioDiscovery'_ includes two analyises. The MORDM analysis followed by scenario discovery. The calculation of the robustness metrics can also be found in this file. 

Finally, there is a folder _'final assignment'_ this folder includes all the model data that is required to run the model and the previously mentioned Jupyter scripts. 

There are also two important results folders _'FINAL_MORDM_data.gz'_ and 'Folder'.  _'FINAL_MORDM_data.gz'_ contains the results from the re-evaluation over 1000 scenarios, while 'Folder' contains the results of the open exploration
